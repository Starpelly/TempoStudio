# TempoStudio
Unity/C# portion of Bits &amp; Bop's audio engine

Nothing more than a simple decompilation. It's not guarenteed that everything works, but this is all I could find.

Nothing here is magic, and everything here you or anyone could easily decompile yourself. Do not ask me to make a full decompilation for the commercial release. This is merely for convience and educational purposes.

## Support the Developers of Bits and Bops
This project was created purely for educational purposes.

I do not own "TempoStudio" in any way, shape or form, and this wouldn't be possible had they not developed the engine in the first place.
Bits and Bops is a commercial product, and to be honest I probably shouldn't share this. Too late I guess.
